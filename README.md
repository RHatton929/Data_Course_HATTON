# Data_Course_HATTON

This README file contains information about my uploaded assignments. Additional text is being added for the purpose of practice with git. I have looked up what kinds of things to put into a README file, and this next commit will test one.

- Try making a list
- Attempt _italics_
- __Bold__ some text

I think that hit the required number of commits for this assignment, but a few more couldn't hurt. This is actually kind of fun! Here I am, testing to make sure everything is still functional at a later date. My creativity is waning, so I'll leave you with a good quote:

> **Douglas Adams**
>> *“If I were not an atheist, I think I would have to be a Catholic because if it wasn't the forces of natural selection that designed fish, It must have been an Italian.”*
