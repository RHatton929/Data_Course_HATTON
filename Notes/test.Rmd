knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Summary of Cars

This is a summary of the cars dataset

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

That's Great!
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
iris %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length,
             y = Sepal.Width,
             color = Species)) +
  geom_point()
  
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
